# 📊 Keyword Co-Occurrence Network Analysis

This project explores how research trends evolve over time by analyzing **20,000+ author keywords** across five yearly datasets (2020–2024). Using a combination of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Network Analysis**, the project identifies central keywords, builds co-occurrence networks, and visualizes shifts in research focus.

## 🔍 Project Overview

* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and standardized raw keyword data using **NLTK** and regex to remove duplicates and noise.
* **Network Modeling:** Constructed co-occurrence networks with **NetworkX**, capturing **1,000+ unique keywords and 5,000+ relationships**.
* **Centrality & Clustering:** Applied graph metrics (degree centrality, clustering) to uncover the most influential keywords.
* **Visualization:** Built keyword frequency plots and network graphs using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to highlight keyword clusters.
* **Trend Analysis:** Revealed a **15–20% annual shift** in dominant research themes, highlighting emerging areas such as AI, sustainability, and healthcare.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Languages/Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, NetworkX, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Techniques:** Text Mining, NLP, Network Analysis, Data Visualization

## 📈 Key Outcomes

* Demonstrated the use of **NLP + Graph Theory** to detect evolving research patterns.
* Built a reusable workflow for large-scale **text-based trend analysis**.
* Provided insights into interdisciplinary growth and the dynamic nature of academic research.
